Changelog: I completed the budget from Part 1 of the POE. I included the sitemap in the Buisness Proposal 1 file. In the website I added a button on the Products page which takes the user to a google form to select which products they want to purchase as well as a button on the Enquiry page which allows people to apply to become a model.

Part 2: I created a style sheet to add a basic style to all the pages. Researched the basic breakpoints for different devices and added them to the CSS style sheet. Reorganised the wedpages to create a better design.
