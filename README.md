Changelog: I completed the budget from Part 1 of the POE. I included the sitemap in the Buisness Proposal 1 file. In the website I added a button on the Products page which takes the user to a google form to select which products they want to purchase as well as a button on the Enquiry page which allows people to apply to become a model.

Part 2: I created a style sheet to add a basic style to all the pages. Researched the basic breakpoints for different devices and added them to the CSS style sheet. Reorganised the wedpages to create a better design.

Part 3: I added an interactive map and animated the product images so that when they are hovered over the image becomes larger. I also added meta tags to the webpages. I changed the alt texts of the product images to be more descriptive. I created the robots.txt file.
