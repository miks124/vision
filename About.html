    <h1><b>Our history:</b></h1>
    <p><br>Vision was established in 2023 by a highschool student and his father in order to create an extra
         income for the family. Our idea was to bring America fashion to South Africa at an affordable price. 
         We started by using our Instagram and Tiktok pages to promote our clothing line by posting countless images
          of our products. From making designs on our phones and making the clothes in our garage we have been able
           to expand to the point of being able to have our own website and hopefully have retail stores in the future.
    </p>
   
    <h1><b>Our vision and mision:</b></h1>
    <p><br> Vision aims to sell affordable and stylish clothing that represents the America fashion style. It allows
         for South Africans to wear the type of clothes they want to without having to break the bank to get it. 
         The long-term vision of the company is to become a globally recognised brand with its own retail stores
          in malls across Southern Africa.
